            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>The Short Version</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>ChoreUp does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.</strong>
                    Everything stays on your device. We literally cannot see your family's information.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>No Account Required</h2>
                <p>
                    ChoreUp works entirely without accounts, logins, or registration. You download the app
                    and start using it immediately. There's no sign-up process because we don't need any
                    information from you.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>Data Storage</h2>
                <p>
                    All data you create in ChoreUp—including children profiles, chores, rewards, points,
                    and any photos taken for proof of completion—is stored locally on your iPhone.
                    This data never leaves your device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use Apple's SwiftData framework to store your information securely in your device's
                    private app container. Only you have access to this data.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
                <p>
                    ChoreUp does not include any analytics, tracking pixels, advertising SDKs, or
                    third-party data collection tools. We don't track how you use the app, which
                    features you access, or how often you open it.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>No Network Requests</h2>
                <p>
                    ChoreUp works completely offline. The app does not make any network requests to
                    our servers or any third-party servers. There is no "phone home" functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only network activity that may occur is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>App Store purchase verification (handled entirely by Apple)</li>
                    <li>App updates through the App Store (handled entirely by Apple)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>Photos</h2>
                <p>
                    When you enable photo proof for chores, kids can take photos to show their completed
                    work. These photos are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stored only in ChoreUp's private app container on your device</li>
                    <li>Never uploaded anywhere</li>
                    <li>Not accessible to other apps</li>
                    <li>Deleted when you delete the associated chore completion or uninstall the app</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    ChoreUp is designed for family use with children. Because we don't collect any data
                    at all, we fully comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and
                    similar regulations worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Children's names and any information you enter about them stays entirely on your
                    device under your control.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
                <p>
                    Since all data is stored on your device:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delete individual items anytime within the app</li>
                    <li>Uninstalling ChoreUp removes all associated data from your device</li>
                    <li>There's nothing on our servers to delete because we don't have servers storing your data</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>Data Export (Pro Feature)</h2>
                <p>
                    ChoreUp Pro includes data export functionality. When you export your data, it creates
                    a file on your device that you control. We never receive or see this exported data.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    If we ever change this privacy policy, we will update this page and the "Last updated"
                    date above. However, our core commitment will never change: your data stays on your
                    device, and we will never collect it.
                </p>
